### Goal
The goal of we train a agent is that we want the agent to play the game by itself until
can find an appropriate way, i.e. a good policy, to play the game well.
### How we train the agent?
Agent must find a good policy to survive by some algorithms or models.
Basically, this is a control and optimization problem. We need control the agent so that
it can consecutively optimize its algorithm until it acquires the best returns.
